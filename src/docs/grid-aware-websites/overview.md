# Grid-aware Websites - Overview

Weâ€™re creating a toolkit to enable developers and designers to understand more about the electricity a visitor is consuming when on their website and adjust the design accordingly. We call websites that respond to the electricity grid in this way grid-aware.

## What's in the toolkit?

The toolkit, which is currently under development, will consist of:

- An open-source code library.
- Technical documentation including explainer guides, tutorials and case studies.
- A UX/UI catalogue of design ideas.

## What's a grid-aware website? How impactful are they?  

We've got answers to these questions, and many more, in the FAQ section of [this project's homepage on our website](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/grid-aware-websites/#whats-a-gaw).

## Case studies

Below are some public case studies from people who've used the Grid-aware Websites code and UI/UX toolkit in real world projects. If you've done the same, and would like to share your experience, please [contact us](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/support-form/?wpf2192_9=Another%20subject) via our website.
