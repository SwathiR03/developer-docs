      "body": "Currently, the models available in CO2.js are frontend focused, with a bias towards estimating website carbon emissions. We would like to see additional models that can be used for other areas of digital emissions estimation added to CO2.js.\r\n\r\nOne area that we believe could benefit from this is the estimation of server-side emissions. We believe that having a simple implementation that can estimate the emissions of running some code on a server would be extremely useful for developers. We have seen some implementations of this in other languages. Most of the libraries listed in the recent GitHub blog post on [sustainable software tools](https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/the-10-best-tools-to-green-your-software/) do this in some way.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to discuss what an implementation might look like in CO2.js. It might be a lite version of Cloud Carbon Footprint, or some other existing methodology. It might be a wrapper around some other tooling or library that we can include as a dependancy. It might simply be a reference model that takes some basic inputs (e.g. server model, usage duration, used capacity) and returns a result - this again would have to be based on some existing model.\r\n\r\nThis work would tie in closely with making CO2.js extensible by converting it to a plugin-based architecture as outlined in #206.",

It would allow for an ecosystem of data plugins to be built for use in CO2.js that would allow developers to access data for specific energy grids (national, regional, local). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDevelopers would be able to import an appropriate plugin that can be used for fetch grid intensity from a regional API. That data would be returned to CO2.js and exposed via a set of pre-defined (yet to be defined) APIs that would provide a standard way for developers to interact across plugins.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis feature is primarily focused on developers who want data for a single location. Developers could write their own code to fetch data from any API, though this would be non-standardised and time consuming. Alternately, they could use services like Electricity Maps or WattTime to get this information for a specific location however there might be no guarantee that data is available through those services or it may end up being prohibitive cost-wise for the developer.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nInitial candidates for implementation are:\r\n\r\n- The UK National grid (https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/)",

What this might look like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {sci, co2} from \"@tgwf/co2\";\r\n\r\n// Use the SWDM v4 to estimate operational & embodied emissions for 1000 bytes\r\nconst model = new co2({ model: \"swd\", version: 4, results: \"segment\" });\r\nconst estimate = operationalModel.perVisit(1000)\r\n\r\nconst example = new sci({ \r\n  operationalEmissions: estimate.totalOperationalCO2e, \r\n  embodiedEmissions: estimate.totalEmbodiedCO2e, \r\n  functionalUnit: \"page visit\" \r\n});\r\n\r\n// This would return a SCI score for each web page visit.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be extended to provide a means for developers to \"experiment\" with different inputs to see the SCI score that would be returned. This could be useful in planning, prototyping, or ideation phases for projects. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say a developer wants to see how changing the location of a workload might impact the SCI score for a database backup process that runs once a day for 1 hour. They have knowledge of, or guestimate, the following:\r\n\r\n- Grid intensity at both locations being compared\r\n- Operational energy used by the database backup process\r\n- Embodied emissions of the hardware used to run the process\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {sci} from \"@tgwf/co2\";\r\n\r\nconst locationAGridIntensity = 300 // grams CO2e per kilowatt-hour\r\nconst locationBGridIntensity = 325 // grams CO2e per kilowatt-hour\r\n\r\nconst totalEmbodiedEmissions = 1500 // grams CO2e\r\nconst timeReserved = 1  // The duration of the batch job, in hours per day\r\nconst expectedLife = 6 * 365 * 24 // 6 years expected hardware life, converted into hours\r\nconst resourcesReserved = 2 // Assuming the backup job runs on a shared cloud instance & uses 2 vCPUs\r\nconst totalResources = 8 // The total vCPUs on the cloud instance\r\n\r\nconst operationalEnergy = 20 // Kilowatts per run\r\n\r\nconst scoreLocationA = new sci({ \r\n  operationEnergy: operationalEnergy, \r\n  intensity: locationAGridIntensity, \r\n  embodiedEmissions: {\r\n    totalEmbodiedEmissions,\r\n    expectedLife,\r\n    timeReserved,\r\n    resourcesReserved,\r\n    totalResources,\r\n  },\r\n  functionalUnit: \"backup job run\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Let's say the data center at locationB refresh their hardware every 4 years instead of 6 years. We can reflect this in our inputs.\r\n\r\nconst expectedLifeLocationB = 4 * 365 * 24\r\n\r\nconst scoreLocationB = new sci({ \r\n  operationEnergy: operationalEnergy, \r\n  intensity: locationBGridIntensity, \r\n  embodiedEmissions: {\r\n    totalEmbodiedEmissions,\r\n    expectedLifeLocationB,\r\n    timeReserved,\r\n    resourcesReserved,\r\n    totalResources,\r\n  },\r\n  functionalUnit: \"backup job run\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n_This could open up the possibility for developers to use multiple models in calculating an SCI score as well._\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis **would not** be a replacement for other tools like [Impact Framework](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/). However, it would complement Impact Framework and allow an easily approachable initial entry to the SCI for developers first touching the topic or those who'd like to use SCI but cannot easily change their codebase to utilise Impact Framework.",

      "body": "One of the ongoing discussions in digital sustainability refers to whether network transfer is a good proxy for online activity that would result in emissions.\r\n\r\nA new paper by [David Mytton](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/authored-by/Mytton/David), [Dag Lundén](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/authored-by/Lund%C3%A9n/Dag), [Jens Malmodin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/authored-by/Malmodin/Jens), called **Network energy use not directly proportional to data volume: The power model approach for more reliable network energy consumption calculations** explores this in more detail.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a placeholder for future investigation about how feasible implementing the model might for us inside CO2.js.\r\n\r\nThis issue isn't really for discussing the research, just how it might be implemented if it was added. I think the W3C mailing list might be a better place for wider discussion about the paper. I'll add a link to a thread there when the email shows up in the public archive.\r\n\r\nHere's the [link to the thread discussing the paper in the w3c susty web list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sustyweb/2024Jul/0000.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Model name**\r\n\r\nAYUPM As Yet Unnamed Power Model - the paper does not give a specific and catchy name, so I'm using this acronym until we might get a steer from them,\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n\r\n_Provide a link/s to documentation explaining the model and how it is implemented._\r\n\r\nNone yet, sorry.\r\n\r\n**Research**\r\n_Provide links to the underlying research that the model is built upon._\r\n\r\nFrom the abstract:\r\n\r\n> It is commonly assumed that data volume and network energy consumption are directly proportional, a notion perpetuated by numerous studies and media coverage. This paper challenges this assumption, offering a comprehensive examination of network operations to explain why the relationship between energy consumption and data volume is nonlinear. The power model approach is explored as an alternative methodology for calculating network energy consumption providing a more reliable representation of network energy use. The power model demonstrates that simple energy intensity calculations, expressed as kilowatt hours per gigabyte of data, are insufficient for accurately estimating real-world network energy consumption.\r\n\r\n[Open Access paper: Network energy use not directly proportional to data volume: The power model approach for more reliable network energy consumption calculations]()https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13512\r\n\r\n**Suitability**\r\n_Give some context and information about what this model is most suitable for measuring. (Example: websites, video streaming, file storage etc.)_\r\n\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n\r\nNo use yet (the model is very new).\r\n\r\nThere is some discussion here in Green Metrics Tool:\r\nhttps://github.com/green-coding-solutions/green-metrics-tool/issues/707",

      "body": "The purpose of this issue is to track the process of transitioning to using the Sustainable Web Design Model (SWDM) version 4 as the default model in CO2.js.\r\n\r\nCurrently, SWDM is the default model used by the library. Developers have the option to switch models ([see docs](https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/models/)) between SWDM and OneByte. With the implementation of SWDM v4 developers also have the option to now switch between different version of SWMD (see #208). **The default SWDM version used by CO2.js is version 3, and developers have to opt-in to switching to the newer version 4 methodology.**\r\n\r\nIn the same way as we previously switched the default model from OneByte to SWDM (see #100) we would also want to eventually update the library to use SWDM version 4 as the default methodology. \r\n\r\nWhile it is not expected that this would be a breaking change, we would still approach this very gradually and communicate it with developers well ahead of time. This issue tracks those tasks, as well as provides a place for conversation about the switch to the newer methodology.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n\r\n- [ ] **[DECISION]** _Decide on a date/version in which SWDM version 4 will be set as the default_\r\n- [ ] **[DECISION]** _Will SWDM version 3 be _removed_ from CO2.js or simply left for developers to \"opt-in\" to using?_\r\n- [ ] Add warning to CO2.js when developers use SWDM version 3\r\n- [ ] Update documentation site to reflect this information\r\n- [ ] Update the CO2.js page on the Green Web Foundation site to reflect this information\r\n- [ ] Update the CO2.js quick start guide to reflect this information\r\n- [ ] Publish announcements through regular release communication channels (LinkedIn, Slack)\r\n- [ ] Prepare Pull Request for change\r\n- [ ] Merge change\r\n- [ ] Publish regular release communication to notify of change\r\n\r\n**Additional context (if applicable)**\r\nRelated to PR: #208 \r\nRelated to Issue: #119 \r\n",

      "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\n_The aim of the suggested changes described below is to enable the addition of more carbon estimation models to CO2.js in a way that is flexible for models that are not based on data transfer (bytes) as a key input_\n\r\nCurrently, we have a number of modules as named exports which allow access to different functions and variables within CO2.js. For example, if you wanted to perform a carbon estimate you'd import the `co2` module as follows:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { co2 } from '@tgwf/co2'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is, however, somewhat limiting in that any new models that are introduced CO2.js would need to conform to the existing functions that are in those models. Sticking with the example of estimating emissions, a new model would need to work within the bounds of the `perByte` or `perVisit` functions. These functions take inputs of `bytes` and `greenHosting`. However, not all models use these inputs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTo allow for greater flexibility as other models are added to CO2.js, a change should be made towards a plugin style system. CO2.js could set some expected defaults, as in a function or output that it _expects all models_ to exports, and then models can be free to use whatever inputs or data they need to behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nFor example, each model plugin could be expected to export a function called `estimate`. _This would be the default function called when that model is used._ Inputs can then be passed into the function via an options objects. The model can also then expose additional functions for specific cases if need be.\r\n\r\nLet's take the example of the Sustainable Web Design Model which is already implemented in CO2.js. It might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// THE BELOW IS JUST AN EXAMPLE\r\n\r\nimport { SustainableWebDesign } from '@tgwf/co2/models`;\r\n\r\n// The model can specify however many optional inputs it wants. The model should also have defaults set for all optional inputs.\r\nconst options = {\r\n  greenHosting: true\r\n};\r\n\r\n// This estimates the emissions for 1000 bytes\r\nconst websiteCarbon = SustainableWebDesign.estimate(1000, options);\r\n\r\nconst optionsPerVisit = {\r\n  bytes: 1000,\r\n  greenHosting: true,\r\n  firstVisitRatio: 0.6,\r\n  returnVisitRatio: 0.4,\r\n  dataReloadRatio: 0.3\r\n};\r\n\r\n// This estimates the emissions of 10 visits to a website of 1000 bytes.\r\nconst websiteCarbonPerVisit = SustainableWebDesign.perVisit(10, optionsPerVisit);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf another model were to be added (let's say for example `onlineEventsModel`) then it would be expected to expose a default `estimate` function, but then could also expose additional functions for specific cases (e.g. `perVideoCall`, `perConference`, `perPodcast` etc.). These additional functions might build upon the functionality of the `estimate` function or could be standalone.",

      "body": "This PR adds the Electricity Maps API as an external data sources which can be accessed within CO2.js (#134).\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new `DataSource` class which is exposed to users. The class has as single function `set()` which is used to set the data source being used.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { dataSources } from '@tgwf/co2';\r\nconst eMaps = new dataSources().set(\"electricityMapsApi\");\r\n\r\neMaps.source.authToken = \"MyAuthToken\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach data source is its own class, and can contain any number of functions which map to the structure of the external API being queried.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Electricity Maps, we use the free API endpoint and expose three functions:\r\n\r\n- `getLatest` - returns the current grid intensity for the region (zone or lat+lon) from the Electricity Maps API. \r\n- `getHistory` - returns the last 24 hours grid intensity for the region (zone or lat+lon) from the Electricity Maps API.\r\n- `getZones` - returns a list of all available zones that can be queried from the Electricity Maps API.\r\n\r\nFor example, to get the latest grid intensity for Taiwan we can:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst taiwanZoneLatest = await eMaps.source.getLatest(\"TW\");\r\n\r\nconst taiwanLatLonLatest = await eMaps.source.getLatest(undefined, \"23.6978\", \"120.9605\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith this update, it will also be possible for additional data sources to be added. The kinds of data sources which could be added are not just limited to grid intensity either, meaning it could be possible to add an adaptor for connecting with a service like the Boavista API (for example) to return environmental impact data for hardware and cloud devices.",

      "body": "There are a few common metrics for reporting the carbon intensity of electricity, especially if we refer to the GHG Protocol:\r\n\r\n1. **location based** - which is usually an weighted average of the carbon intensity of all the generation in a given region \r\n2. **market based** - this accounts for financial instruments people use to 'green' their electricity. In practice this is typically linked to Environmental Attribute Certificates which you can think of as a tradable by-product of generating green electricity, and often traded separately from the power generated.\r\n\r\nThe flip side of market based approach is that if you're paying to make the your use of _your_  energy greener, you're able to do this because in some other part of the world, their electricity is becoming _less_ green.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have sight on this, and if you make claims based on the average carbon intensity of a grid **plus** any certificates you buy on the market to top-up your way to 100% renewable, then it's possible you can be undercounting your impact.\r\n\r\nThere's a good example from Google's recent submission in the consultation about updating the GHG Protocol's approach to Scope 2 carbon emissions emphasis mine:\r\n\r\n> Data demonstrate that many companies do indeed pursue this practice. For example, Norway was responsible for 43% of all guarantees of origin (GOs) exports in Europe in 2022, many of which were purchased by companies whose operations have no connection to the Norwegian grid on which these EACs were produced. **This also explains why, even though Norway’s grid-level emissions factor is 10 kg CO2/MWh17 (98% carbon-free), the residual emissions factor is 402 kg CO2/MWh (7.4% renewable), reflecting that most EACs produced within the Norwegian grid are claimed and retired outside of the country**.\r\n>\r\n> Such a system can and does distort companies’ footprints by understating their reliance on fossil-based electricity. This results in companies not addressing the emissions for which they’re physically responsible, and not supporting the collective and urgent need to decarbonize electricity systems to the degree that they might otherwise. In the above example, Spanish companies that purchase EACs from Norway are not working to decarbonize the electricity grid in Spain, which still relies on fossil fuels for over one-third of its electricity.\r\n\r\nYou can see it in this document in the link below - page 13 and page 14:\r\n\r\nhttp://gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2023-GHGP-Survey-Submission.pdf\r\n\r\nI think this information is published by the AIB, but and this chart shows how accounting for this can totally change the emissions intensity you might take into account when making claims based on market based approaches:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 12 35 06](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/assets/17906/0f4f5a09-ca1f-420e-87a5-2a201c0e4634)\r\n\r\nLook at Iceland (IS) and Norway (NO) specifically - the residual mix vs the production mix are _radically_ different.\r\n\r\nHere's the [underlying doc that came from](https://www.aib-net.org/sites/default/files/assets/facts/residual-mix/2020/AIB_2020_Residual_Mix_Results.pdf)\r\n\r\nI'm unclear on the licensing terms, or how often this data is updated, so it may be the we can't use this, but I'm creating this issue so we can at least discuss it, and have it on our radar.",

There are [existing patterns and guides for using code from npm inside appscripts](https://medium.com/geekculture/the-ultimate-guide-to-npm-modules-in-google-apps-script-a84545c3f57c)\r\n- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) should be compatible, and is an growing alternative to nodejs, that has a few nice features, like being fast to start, and having built in sqlite support\r\n- [Deno](https://deno.land/), [Elsa](https://github.com/elsaland/elsa) are both both runtime for server-side javascript, and can create self-contained compiled binaries that remove the need to have a javascript runtime installed at all.\r\n- [Mongodb uses the same underlying javascript engine as Firefox, Spidermonkey](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/why-change-v8-to-spidermonkey-in-mongodb-js-engine/99871). So, presumably these kinds of calcs could be executed in Mongodb itself, a little bit like how [some folks like Crunchydata do Machine Learning _inside_ Postgres](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/recommendation_engine_in_postgres_with_pandas_and_python) . I'm very much out of my depth here though, and haven't used Mongodb in years, so I have no idea how complicated running your own js in Mongodb is.",

      "body": "The original version implemented based on the 1byte model deliberately left out bits that you wouldn't typically have access to when making calculations, because they were time based, like the duration of transfer used on a device.\r\n\r\nThis was originally derived by looking at the hourly consumption of a device, then dividing that number by the fraction of time a transfer took.\r\n\r\nThis issue [here on the carbonalyser repo helps shed some light](https://github.com/carbonalyser/Carbonalyser/issues/2) - specifically this quote:\r\n\r\n> The contribution of the terminal is calculated for two cases:the performance of an action on a smartphone and an action on a laptop computer. The consumption due to using the terminal is calculated on the basis of the hourly consumption of the terminal and the duration of use associated with the action\r\n\r\nThe full numbers are listed here too\r\nhttps://theshiftproject.org/en/carbonalyser-browser-extension/\r\n\r\nIt also didn't allow setting of carbon intensity, but defaulted to a high global average provided in the original methodology notes listed above.\r\n\r\n### Updating this\r\n\r\nA properly updated model, assuming it's still worth doing given the changes since 2019 would likely to the following:\r\n\r\n- [ ] use updated carbon intensity figures (Ember has these now, freely available)\r\n- [ ] have more explicit guidance on how to represent the embedded emissions from devices the reports make a big deal about extending the life of devices\r\n- [ ] have some sensible way to do work out device usage from duration - perhaps with a weighted average for connection speeds, and devices\r\n\r\nThis issue is here for folks who are not happy with the 1byte model as implemented, and would like to see a more accurate / precise version in use.

      "body": "The Green web foundation API and datasets have historically had a really binary green/grey definition, which is easy to use, but hides a colossal amount of detail.\r\n\r\nTor example there's a whole issue around who you credit for making the commitment for green and how energy - it's easy to assume it's a single company doing all the work to decarbonise because we might be applying the mental model of 'buying green' where you might pay more for a product in return for it being greener.\r\n\r\n### This isn't really how it works with energy\r\n\r\nI think separating out local carbon intensity from other forms of greening electricity is worth exploring, and I'll try explaining why.\r\n\r\n### Intensity (as in carbon intensity)\r\n\r\nYou might affect **_local carbon intensity_** by choosing specific regions for some compute, or time shifting work and looking at the actual carbon intensity. You can think of this as the emissions caused when the electricity is generated and in most cases fed into the grid. \r\n\r\nThis means not relying on offsets, green tariffs or different kinds of carbon credits, and is basically how GHG protocol location based emissions work as well as the software carbon intensity approach used by the Green Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf you can't directly control the grid mix, then claiming you can, and _you alone_ should be credited for energy being green, and therefore having a much lower carbon intensity is problematic.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, [the greening of electricity is paid for by three groups - **_rate payers_**, **_tax payers_** or **_shareholders_**](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/who-pays-for-cleaner-energy-on-the-web/), and I want to make an argument for recognising this, or at least separating it out from carbon intensity discussions.\r\n\r\n### Coverage\r\n\r\nIf you record local carbon intensity, we move on from the fiction that the energy we get from the grid has no carbon footprint. But we still want to recognise efforts being made to _get off fossil fuels_.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before transitioning from fossil fuels is paid for by three main groups of people, **_rate payers_**, **_tax payers_** or **_shareholders_**, often at the same time. This issue is not the best place to go into the details, and the blog post on the green web fdn blog explains it in more detail, but the TLDR is basically: \r\n\r\n> A transition from fossil fuels requires work from lots of groups. If we can separate out the claim that an organisation is contributing to a transition of the internet away from fossil fuels, from the claim about whether energy from a grid has carbon emissions associated with it or not, we probably should do so.\r\n\r\nIf the intensity part is concerned with answering the question:\r\n\r\n> \"what is the carbon footprint of this electricity\"\r\n\r\nThen this one is more about:\r\n\r\n> how much of the energy used is being matched by generation from fossil free sources, on at least an annual basis?\r\n\r\nThis is a mouthful, but the short version is that you need to the last bit to account for the fact that right now, lots of companies are effectively saying they use green energy because they have paid in some way to support something like a solar project.\r\n\r\nIf we look at things on an _annual basis_ the solar farm might generate as much energy as is used by a rack of servers in year. \r\n\r\nAllocating resources to support the solar project is good and necessary, and we should recognise it (this is the criteria we use now with the green web checks).\r\n\r\nBut it's also not nearly enough - energy being generated is _covering_ only a small share of the power being used by servers, because those solar panels typically won't be generating power when a server is being used at night.\r\n\r\nTo have a 24/7 fossil free internet, you'll you'd need _much_ more investment, to cover batteries, and all kinds of other forms of clean energy. Even in a datacentre powering on green energy - it'll still often be deisel generators providing backup.\r\n\r\nThis is where I'm suggesting \"coverage\" as a concept for power being matched by generation from fossil free sources.\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of ways to pay you can do this for 24/7 green energy.\r\n\r\nYou can have your [own run-of-the-river hydro power station](https://datacenterlight.ch/en-us/cms/hydropower/). You can buy [TEACS (high time resolution energy carbon credits)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/t-eacs-offer-new-approach-to-certifying-clean-energy). You can [buy a power purchase agreement with new geothermal providers](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-fervo-geothermal-project-creates-carbon-free-energy), and there are loads more options out there too.\r\n\r\n## How to implement this\r\n\r\nThis is where I'd welcome some feedback.\r\n\r\nIf energy is just matched annually, we still return the true / false figure. If energy is matched at a higher resolution, we return the percentage of energy matched on an hourly basis as well.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// before \r\nconst result = await greencheck.check(\"google.com\"); // returns true\r\n\r\n\r\n// new approach\r\nconst new_result = await greencheck.check(\"google.com\"); // returns truthy object\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously, result would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur truthy object by comparison might look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  yearly: true,\r\n  hourly: 67,\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm intending to bootstrap this with information I can find in the public domain, like google's numbers below, but this approach should also match the example of a smaller provider like Data Centre Light above.\r\n\r\n### Examples this ought to work for:\r\n\r\nHuge megacorp:\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon\r\n\r\nSmaller provider:\r\nhttps://datacenterlight.ch/en-us/cms/hydropower/\r\n\r\nWacky but cool green compute project:\r\nhttp://solarprotocol.net/\r\n\r\nSuper interesting startup providing dispatchable compute colocated by renewable energy plants:\r\nhttps://examesh.de/en/\r\n",
